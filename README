My project developed for my final exam of secondary school, I don't wanna explain what is it now, maybe another time :3.
I developed the client for Win(but I used wxWidgets, so you can compile it for Linux with not so many problems), the server is written for Linux(even this written with wxWidgets)

Edit 05/11/2011: 
    I managed to compile the Client even on Linux with no problems, but I didn't test it yet :P.
    To compile it:
        g++ `wx-config --libs` `wx-config --libs` `mysql_config --cflags` `mysql_config --libs` -o JACC ./*.h ./*.cpp

    To compile it on Windows personally I used wxDevC++
