My project developed for my final exam of secondary school, I don't wanna explain what is it now, maybe another time :3.
I developed the client for Win(but I used wxWidgets, so you can compile it for Linux with not so many problems), the server is written for Linux.

Edit 05/11/2011: I managed to compile it for Linux with no problems, but I didn't test it yet :P.
